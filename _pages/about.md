Dr. Kang-Hsien (Frank) Fan is a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Human Genetics at the University of Pittsburgh. His research focuses on the genomic mechanisms that drive neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). With a strong background in biostatistics, bioinformatics, and statistical genetics, Dr. Fan has made significant contributions to understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases. His current work includes using whole-genome sequencing to investigate tissue-specific genetic variations in autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer’s patients, aiming to uncover the biological mechanisms contributing to ADRD risk. He aims to deepen his exploration of tissue-specific genomic variations and their role in neurodegeneration.

Dr. Fan aims to build bioinformatics workflows that advance ADRD research and foster collaborations between the University of Pittsburgh ADRC and external research partners.

As an OSCAR Scholar in the Biomarker and Neurogenetics Core, Dr. Fan is dedicated to mentoring students and postdoctoral fellows, helping them develop expertise in genomics and bioinformatics. Through the OSCAR program, he hopes to expand his research network, enhance his leadership skills, and secure funding to advance his research into the genetic architecture of Alzheimer’s disease.
