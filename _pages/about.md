I began my academic career in 2010 as a staff cancer biostatistician at the Vanderbilt Center for Quantitative Sciences, Vanderbilt School of Medicine, after completing dual master’s degrees in Biostatistics and Bioinformatics. At Vanderbilt, I contributed to more than 30 biomedical research publications, including several in high-impact medical journals. A highlight of this work was receiving the Best Collaborative Publication Award for a prostate cancer study published in The New England Journal of Medicine (2013; 368(5):436-445).

My early clinical research experience sparked a deep interest in high-throughput data analysis, particularly microarray-based RNA expression, which motivated me to pursue advanced training in genomics and transcriptomics. I earned my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics from the University of Georgia in 2017, and shortly thereafter joined the Department of Human Genetics at the University of Pittsburgh as a Research Assistant Professor. At Pitt, I expanded my research to the genomics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), analyzing diverse phenotypes—including genetic risk factors, PET imaging data, and plasma biomarkers—using platforms such as genome-wide SNP arrays, whole-genome and exome sequencing, and total RNA sequencing. This work advanced our understanding of AD pathology through integrative, multi-omic approaches.

In October 2024, I was honored with the Optimizing Scientific Careers in AD Research (OSCAR) Scholar award from the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), recognizing my contributions to AD genomics and biomarker research. This recognition reflects my role in the ADRC’s Research Education Component, which fosters the career development of early-career investigators in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD).

In January 2025, I was promoted to Assistant Professor in recognition of my research accomplishments, teaching experience, and mentorship of over fifteen master’s and doctoral students and four postdoctoral fellows. As a statistical bioinformatician, I specialize in the design and analysis of clinical studies, processing of high-throughput datasets, and functional annotation in downstream analyses. My expertise spans genome-wide association studies (GWAS), quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, expression QTL (eQTL) analyses, and allele-specific expression (ASE), providing a comprehensive framework to connect genetic variation with disease mechanisms.

Currently, my research focuses on applying single-nucleus DNA and RNA sequencing to investigate tissue-specific variation that contributes to the pathogenesis of complex human diseases. By integrating my multidisciplinary expertise across cancer and neurodegenerative disease research, I aim to uncover molecular mechanisms that will inform the development of more precise diagnostic tools and targeted therapeutic strategies.
