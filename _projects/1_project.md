I am currently engaged in genomic research on late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), with expertise in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analyses.

Recently, I conducted a GWAS of in vivo brain amyloid deposition measured by Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB)-PET imaging. This work confirmed the well-established association of APOE with amyloid deposition and identified potential novel loci contributing to amyloid aggregation.

In addition, I have performed GWAS on neuropathological endophenotypes derived from Alzheimer’s disease brain tissue, including amyloid burden, tau burden, and HLA-DR area fraction, leading to the identification of novel genetic loci.

I also lead projects analyzing cognitive GWAS data as well as whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing datasets.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even reference this for citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
