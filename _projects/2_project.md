The Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study (PCOS) is a long-term, survey-based cohort study of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States between 1993 and 1998. In 2010, more than 3,000 follow-up surveys were collected to support further research.

The first project examined urinary, bowel, and sexual function as quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes, comparing patients who underwent prostatectomy versus radiotherapy. Using a mixed-effects model, the analysis showed that treatment choice significantly affected QoL in the immediate post-treatment period; however, these differences diminished over the long term.

The second project evaluated mortality outcomes between the two treatment groups. Survival analysis revealed evidence of treatment selection bias within this cohort, reflecting clinical practice patterns of the 1990s. The third project investigated the impact of age, tumor risk, and comorbidities on survival time.

Results from the competing-risks analysis provided guidance for tailoring treatment recommendations for future prostate cancer patients based on their overall health status.
