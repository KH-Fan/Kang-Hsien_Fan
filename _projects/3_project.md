B-cell activating factor (BAFF) SNPs are associated with autoimmune diseases. Because patients with classic and overlap chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) exhibit autoimmune-like features, we studied the association of recipient and donor BAFF SNPs with GVHD phenotypes after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We identified nine BAFF SNPs as independent risk factors distinguishing GVHD from non-GVHD status, and four recipient BAFF SNPs as independent predictors of specific GVHD subtypes.
